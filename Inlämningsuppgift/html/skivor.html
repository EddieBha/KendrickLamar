    <h3>
        <b>Who is Kendrick Lamar?</b>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Kendrick Lamar Duckworth (born June 17, 1987) is an American rapper and songwriter. Born and raised in Compton,
        California, Lamar embarked on his musical career as a teenager under the stage name K-Dot, releasing a mixtape
        that garnered local attention and led to his signing with indie record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). He
        began to gain recognition in 2010, after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. The following year, he
        independently released his first studio album, Section.80, which included his debut single, "HiiiPoWeR". By that
        time, he had amassed a large online following and collaborated with several prominent artists in the hip hop
        industry, including The Game, Busta Rhymes, and Snoop Dogg.</p>

    <p> Lamar's major label debut album, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was released in 2012 by TDE, Aftermath, and Interscope
        Records to critical success. It debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart and was later certified
        platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The record contained the top 40 singles
        "Swimming Pools (Drank)", "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe", and "Poetic Justice". </p>

    <p> Lamar won his first Grammy Award for "i", the lead single from his critically acclaimed third album To Pimp a
        Butterfly (2015). The album, drawing on free jazz, funk, soul, and spoken word, debuted atop the charts in the
        US and the UK, and won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 58th ceremony. In 2016, Lamar released
        Untitled Unmastered, a collection of unreleased demos that originated during the recording sessions for
        Butterfly. He released his fourth album Damn in 2017 to further acclaim; its lead single "Humble" topped the US
        Billboard Hot 100 chart.</p>

    <p> Lamar has received a number of accolades over the course of his career, including seven Grammy Awards. In early
        2013, MTV named him the number one "Hottest MC in the Game", on their annual list. Time named him one of the 100
        most influential people in the world in 2016. Aside from his solo career, Lamar is also known as a member of the
        West Coast hip hop supergroup Black Hippy, alongside his TDE label-mates and fellow South Los Angeles-based
        rappers Ab-Soul, Jay Rock, and Schoolboy Q.
